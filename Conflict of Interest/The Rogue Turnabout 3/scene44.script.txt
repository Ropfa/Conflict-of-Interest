"She was amazing!"
"She always knew what she believed in and was willing to stand up for it."
"I think that's what drew me to her."

"It's hard to find people nowadays who are willing to stand up for what's right."

char watters e=sad
"Yeah. She was so full of conviction."
"Naive conviction{p20}, but conviction."

"But she wouldn't listen."
"She got a bit too close... Did a few things they didn't like..."
"...and she died for it."
"All the people on that list are politicians and police officers who've tried to fight the Family over the years."
"Of all the things we might've found today... I never imagined it would be that."

"Those people died doing the right thing."

char watters e=sad
"That doesn't matter! Don't you see, man?"
"They all tried to be good people, and they died for it. Sandy died for it!"
"There's no justice in that!"
