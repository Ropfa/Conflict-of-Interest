"Now see here! What kind of job do you people think you're running?"
char Chief hide
"I've already told you! We don't know where this Dan Polo guy is!"
char Inspector hide
"We followed him here!"
char Chief hide
"Your equipment must have been faulty."
char Inspector hide
"We were using the stuff that YOU lent us!"
char Chief hide
"Well, I don't know what to say."
"By the way, what's a pair of English cops doing here in America?"
"Shouldn't this be under our jurisdiction?"
char Inspector hide
"You clearly aren't doing your work properly!"
char Chief hide
"Irregardless, I'm going to have to ask you two to leave the search up to us. We can handle it."
char Inspector hide
""Irregardless"? What the devil is this?"
char Police hide
"I don't believe "irregardless" is actually a word, sir."
char Inspector hide
"It isn't! They can't even speak there own language in this country, much less catch a criminal!"
char Police hide
"How unfortunate, sir."
char Inspector hide
"Get the car ready. We're leaving."
char Police hide
"Yes, sir. Right away, sir."
