"No, I {sfx shout-general}didn't!!"
char obadiah e=front-serious
"You were disbarred for it. That was {n}the best thing that could have {n}happened for the courts."
"It's a shame they let you back in."

"I was {sfx shout-general}framed! They only gave me {n}back my badge after I was proven {n}innocent."

"He's right, Maya."
